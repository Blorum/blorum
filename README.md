## Install prerequisite

## How to install

> git clone https://github.com/SorenEricMent/blorum

...As simple as that

Blorum provided three install modes for you to choose

- Noob mode

Only ask you basic informations, done quick.


- Expert mode

Ask you about basic informations, site configs..., this mode is suggested.


- Lunatic Expert mode

Ask you to config EVERY values and flags, takes an EXTREMELY long time, be sure if you want to use it.


In the process of installation, if you typoed, you could input "back" to change the answer to previous quesition.

## Update

It is highly not suggested to run *npm update*, since blorum tweaked some packages, and update them will cause unexpected result.

Or at lease, do not update the following packages:

- body-parser
